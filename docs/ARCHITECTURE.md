`pinchards.is` is a **redirect Worker** onto those art paths (citations / bookmarks).

## Media

Photos are **not** in git. Full and thumbnail JPEGs live in R2, public hostnames:

- `cloudberry-images.adamsimms.xyz`
- `cloudberry-thumbs.adamsimms.xyz`

## Catalog and viewer

1. **Catalog** — builders under `scripts/` produce the catalog JSON / nest used by the static viewer.
2. **Static archive** — builders under `scripts/` write `dist-archive/` for art assemble.
3. **Viewer** — `js/viewer.js` reads the catalog (`catalogUrl` / `basePath`) on the art host; deep links use `?filename=`.

Capture-date and weather caches under `images/photo/.cache/` feed the builder where still used.

## Shipping

Art CI checks out this repo, builds the static archive, copies into Pages `dist`, deploys. Optional `repository_dispatch` from this repo triggers that workflow. Details: art [CLOUDBERRY-ASSEMBLE.md](https://github.com/adamsimms/art.adamsimms.xyz/blob/main/docs/CLOUDBERRY-ASSEMBLE.md).
