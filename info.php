                <h3>About</h3>

                <p><strong>Cloudberry</strong> was an off-the-grid, solar-powered, long-term photography project. Using a GoPro, a Raspberry Pi, and a USB cellular modem, the system we designed took one photograph per hour between 8 AM and 8 PM each day and uploaded the images via a cellular network to this website.</p>

                <p>The photographs depict a view of Pinchard's Island from a small, family-owned cabin named "Precious Memories." The island, only accessible by boat for a few weeks of the year, is home to a few cabins that resettled residents use while picking bake apples (the local term for cloudberries) during the summer months.</p>

                <p>The view was static—in the sense that the camera always captured the same frame; however, the lighting of the frame could vary drastically from one image to another. They extended the habit of glancing out the cabin window at the surrounding landscape.</p>

                <?php if ($cloudberryArchiveSpan !== null): ?>
                <p>Cloudberry operated from <?= pinchard_h($cloudberryArchiveSpan['start']) ?> through <?= pinchard_h($cloudberryArchiveSpan['end']) ?>. The camera system eventually failed—likely from cold, weathering, too little sun, or some combination. This website is the archive and documentation of what it captured.</p>

                <h3>Okay, but why Pinchard's Island?</h3>

                <p><a href="http://adamsim.ms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam</a> has been photographing <a href="http://adamsim.ms/pinchards-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinchard's Island</a> and its previous residents for several years. The harsh weather conditions and the extreme remoteness of the island made it difficult to access the island year round and take images over long periods of time. Cloudberry grew from the desire to be able to photograph the island throughout the year from anywhere via the internet.</p>

                <p>Shortly after Newfoundland joined Canada as its 10th province, Pinchard's Island was <a href="http://adamsim.ms/resettlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resettled</a> in an attempt to modernize the province. Adam has been documenting the return of his grandmother, along with her brothers and sisters, to this island each summer in an attempt to write the future of resettlement by reviving traditions and creating new ones.</p>

                <h3>Where is Pinchard's Island?</h3>
                <p>Pinchard's Island is situated at the northern edge of Bonavista Bay, Newfoundland, Canada. It was one of the first settled sites in Bonavista Bay but is no longer inhabited.</p>

                <h3>How?</h3>

                <p>Adam and Angela met early May 2017 to briefly discuss the possibility of collaborating together. The idea was loose, but the goal was to take photos of the island remotely, upload the images via the cellular network and access them from anywhere. We both shared connections to Newfoundland, and a passion for art and technology, so we set out to see what was possible.</p>

                <p>Our initial research showed that there were a lot of possibilities as to how we could approach the project, but it was clear from the beginning that every decision would result in many constraints that would affect every decision we made. Power, temperature, weather, sunlight, data limits, storage, remoteness, were all components that constantly determined decision making and the methods in which we worked.</p>

                <p>We used <a href="http://www.trello.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello</a> to plan every aspect of the project, communicate, and document our research:</p>

                <a href="https://trello.com/b/eYzSO4qQ/shutter-island" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="images/info/trello.jpg" class="img-fluid info_img" alt="Trello project board" width="1408" height="706" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a>

                <p>Designing a system that worked was only the start of the project. Every slight adjustment that we made to the system, such as moving from electricity to solar power, putting the USB cellular modem in a case or using different USB cables introduced new problems that we had to constantly monitor and resolve. Once we felt confident in our system, we had to be realistic that once the system was installed on the island, we would not be able to physically be there to troubleshoot any problem that might arise. This forced us to evaluate the entire solution and implement different components to help reduce the risk factor of the project.</p>

                <p>The entire system took us approximately 3 months to build. This includes the initial idea, research, system design, installation, and final production code.

The Raspberry Pi field software is open source as <a href="https://github.com/adamsimms/cloudberry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudberry</a>.</p>

                <h3>Installation</h3>
                <p>During the second week of August, we embarked on our journey to install Cloudberry. The first task was to bring all of the solar power components to the island, which was a task that required four people to load the housing unit, batteries, and solar panel. It took approximately two days for Roger and Adam to install the entire system with constant readjustments.</p>

                <p>The second step was to choose the frame of the photograph and install the Cam Do enclosure. Pointing the camera towards the north avoided sun blasting and offers views of both the landscape and the ocean.</p>

                <p>Once the entire system was in place, we monitored everything for a full day cycle before locking up all of the cases and leaving the island.</p>
